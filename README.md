# Task_5_Capturing_And_Analyzing_Network_Traffic_Using_Wireshark

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To capture real-time network traffic and analyze common network protocols such as DNS, HTTP, and TCP using Wireshark.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Wireshark

---

## ðŸ“Œ Steps To Be Followed (on Linux)

1. Install Wireshark.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install wireshark
   ```
   
2. Start Wireshark and select the active network interface.
   
3. Visit or ping any website to generate traffic.
  
4. Stop the capture after 1 minute.
   
5. Apply protocol filters like `dns`, `http`, and `icmp`.
   
7. Identifiable protocols:
   - **DNS**: Queries to resolve domain names.
   - **HTTP**: GET requests and server responses (unencrypted).
   - **ICMP**: Echo requests/replies via ping.

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables
- Packet Capture File: `task5_capture.pcap`
  
---

## âœ… Outcome
The above task will help to observe how protocols work at a packet level. It gives insights into how data moves through the network and how different layers (transport, application) interact.
